     <h3>Pic of the Week</h3>
     <p>This week's Pic of the Week is the very well known 'Well Hung Lover'! You will find this piece by Banksy by looking over the bridge at the bottom
        of Park Street towards Basement 45. This art piece is one of Banksy's most famous pieces due to the story behind...</p>

     <h3>Girl on a Swing - JPS</h3>
     <p>Not so much is known about this piece but although it is believed by many to be a geniune
     Banksy, it is infact a piece by the almost-equally-well-known JPS (Jamie Paul Scanlon).
     This stencil based piece was sprayed in 2013 and it clearly draws on Banksy’s style and subject
     matter, but that is no surprise as JPS credits his emergence and confidence as a street artist
     with a visit he made to a Banksy exhibition at Bristol Museum.</p>

     <h3>Paint Pot Angel - Banksy</h3>
     <p>This piece was created back in 2009 when Banksy had collaborated with the Bristol Museum
       and Art Gallery on an exhibition called Banksy versus Bristol Museum. In true Banksy style,
       it featured a burnt-out ice cream van on the Museum’s front steps and fishfingers floating
       in a goldfish bowl. Most famous of all was the sculpture of an angel, which stands in the
       Museum’s sculpture hall, over whose head Banksy had dumped a can of pink paint, leaving
       the can in place. This became known as ‘Paint Pot Angel’. In fact, the piece became so iconic
       that the Museum has left it untouched over the past eight years.</p>

     <h3>Spartacus - JPS</h3>
     <p>This piece created by the artist JPS was made to pay tribute to the late Welsh actor Andy
       Whitfield who died aged 39 in 2011 after an 18-month battle with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
       Whitfield can be seen in his most well-known role as Spartacus in the Starz television series
       on the side of the Queen Shilling on Frogmore Street.</p>

     <h3>Well Hung Lover - Banksy</h3>
     <p>This is probably the most well known pice of street art in Bristol. Also known as Naked Man Hanging
       From Window, or just Naked Man, Banksy’s Well Hung Lover adds a bit of unexpected art to a sexual health
       clinic. The famous, anonymous street artist painted it in 2006, and it later became the United Kingdom’s
       first piece of legal street art. As with most graffiti, the city council originally wasn’t too keen on
       the unsanctioned artwork, but locals supported it. When the council sent out an online poll about
       whether to remove it or not, 97% of the respondents voted in favor of letting Banksy’s art stay.
       Unfortunately, even the council’s eventual approval couldn’t completely protect the renowned street
       artist’s work. In June 2009, vandals fired blue paint balls at the image and defaced it. Most of the
       resulting blurry blobs of paint were removed, though the bits of paint that actually hit the image
       were left since removing them would further damage the mural. In 2018, it was vandalized yet again
       when someone sprayed rude graffiti tags on the wall. </p>

     <h3>Queen Jubilee - Banksy</h3>
     <p>This piece is strongly believed to be a Banksy piece but this has not been completely confirmed.
     The piece shows the crown-wearing monarch sporting a jagged red stripe, just like the 1970s David
     Bowie creation. The piece sprang up as the country celebrated her 60 years on the throne and appeared
     on a wall that has already been used by Banksy.</p>
