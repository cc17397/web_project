     <h3>Artist to whitewash £568k Banksy because 'street art shouldn't be bought and sold'</h3>
     <p>Slave Labour was originally painted on the side of a Poundland shop in north London but was sold yesterday (November 14) at an

     <p>Banksy has played what could be one of the most audacious stunts in art history, arranging for one of his best-known works
        to self-destruct after being sold at auction for just over £1m. Girl With Balloon was the final item in an auction at Sotheby’s
        in London on Friday night and its sale price equalled the artist’s previous auction record of £1.04m. Shortly after the hammer
        came down...</p>
